## Understanding the `Flow` Entity

The intention is that a `Flow` (identified by a `Flow` ID) provides a simple way to identify a particular expression of a `Source`. A `Flow` is a timed-data interface that might be implemented in different ways. These different implementations of a `Flow` are called `Flow Representation`s.

In general, it is important not to think of a `Flow` as something that is stored in a file or carried in network packets &ndash; that is a `Flow Representation` and is just one practical realisation of the `Flow`. The `Flow` ID carried along with, or associated with, this `Flow Representation` is of importance here. It is this `Flow` ID that identifies the content and the interface (that is, as well as identifying the content it communicates what can be expected when handling the data). It helps to inform the user about how the data can be handled. For example:

* It might be that a decoder is expected to handle either all the `Flow Representation`s of a particular `Flow` or only a subset of the `Flow Representation`s.
* It might be that either: each transport used to carry a particular `Flow` requires a different `Flow Representation`; or that all transports used can carry any of the `Flow Representation`s.

In each scenario a decision needs to be made about the level at which to set the `Flow`. The most practical level is chosen: this is the lowest level that is considered interesting for the scenario. A `Flow` might be set at a low level in which case all associated `Flow Representation`s will be very similar. Alternatively, a `Flow` can be set at a higher level in which case the associated `Flow Representation`s can be much more varied in how they implement the `Flow`.

There is a need to work across a very wide range of different scenarios (involving both media and data; that is, all kinds of content `Source`s). Across these scenarios there are practical reasons for handling data at different levels. In some scenarios, the sequences of bytes used to represent the data are of interest and this is the level we principally want to work at. In other scenarios, these sequences of bytes are not of interest and we principally want to handle the data at a higher (more conceptual) level. So, the lowest level that is interesting is at a different position in each scenario (at least when the most common operations are considered).

The need to handle data at different levels is illustrated in these simple examples:

* **Example 1**: A time-based signal consists of a numeric value that varies over time. This is expressed by integers associated with `Time Value`s.
  * We expect the integers to be carried using different serialisations (such as JSON, XML, plain text, binary) on different transports and APIs. The serialisation is known in each carriage (the serialisation is pre-defined, signalled or requested) and it is straightforward to match the serialisation in each case with a suitable decoder.
  * These different serialisations used for the integers are not generally of interest to the consumer of the data &ndash; the expectation is that the data will be decoded and all operations carried out on the integers.
* **Example 2**: A video signal is represented using lossy compression (each video frame is a sequence of bytes generated by a video encoder).
  * Many operations need to be performed without decoding the video due to the cost of this. Therefore, the encoded data is of interest.
  * Also, there are often complexities and subtleties involved in the video coding process which cannot be fully described in practice (such as with technical metadata) but which do have an impact on how the encoded data can be used or the ability of a device to decode it (for example, not all H.264 coded video can be decoded by all H.264 decoders &ndash; the standard provides many options and tools). This too makes the encoded data of interest, and it is useful to be able to identify expressions of the video signal that are encoded in a particular way.

[Further examples of the levels at which a `Flow` might be set are explained alongside `Flow Representation`s](2.4._Explanation_-_Flow_Representation.md#examples-of-flow-representations).

Even if `Flow` is set (for a particular scenario) at a much higher "level" than the `Flow Representation`s, this does not mean that all levels below `Flow` are unimportant. The levels below that defined by the `Flow` are not considered interesting when interfacing with the data but they do need to be taken care of somewhere in the wider system; that is, these lower levels are critical to a successful data transfer but are not of interest once that transfer has completed.

It is typically important for technical metadata to be provided about a `Flow`. This "`Flow` metadata" will apply to all `Flow Representation`s associated with the `Flow`. Some `Flow Representation`s might have extra `Flow Representation`-specific technical metadata associated with them. Additionally, it is important that the level of the `Flow` is clearly defined &ndash; this level might also need to be communicated (using additional metadata properties) between devices.

Guidance on how `Flow`s can be applied to the handling of video and audio can be found in [3.0. Practical Guidance for Media](3.0._Practical_Guidance_for_Media.md)

## Notes on the Formal Definition of `Flow`

### General Notes

A `Flow` can be regarded as a collection of `Entry`s. This collection of `Entry`s does not have any fixed / defined ordering, although the `Entry`s can of course be ordered by `Time Value` if required. However, in some real scenarios there could be `Time Value`-based restrictions on the order in which `Entry`s can be added to an existing `Flow` (for example, for a live media `Flow`). Note: This relates to mutability of the model entities which is commented on in [4.0. Appendix - Commentary](4.0._Appendix_-_Commentary.md#provide-guidance-on-mutability-of-entities-as-used-in-real-scenarios). Also refer to [notes on the relationship between Grains and `Entry`s](4.0._Appendix_-_Commentary.md#address-mapping-of-the-identity-and-timing-model-to-grains).

There is no constraint that requires the technical properties of a `Flow` to be static. For example, the dimensions of a video or its framerate could change over time &ndash; but these properties would change in the same way across all `Flow Representation`s associated with the `Flow`.

There is also no constraint that all `Flow Representation`s which match the technical properties of a particular `Flow` _must_ be part of that `Flow` &ndash; this constraint would not be practical to enforce. However, clearly a `Flow` is most useful if all eligible `Flow Representation`s *are* members (for example, it is generally better if one `Flow` is used rather than two if this is permitted by the scenario and by the definition of `Flow`).

Interpretation of a `Flow` (for example, "rendering" of the `Flow`)  will depend on the exact data types etc used. For example:

* A `Data Object` might still contain some time-based information (e.g. information about how long the effect of the `Data Object` should persist for when rendered).
* The exact interpretation of the `Time Value` with which a `Data Object` is associated will depend on how it is being used:
  * For example, for an SD video frame captured from SDI the `Time Value` might be the time at which the frame signal begins (Line 1) or it could be the time at which the visible picture for the frame begins (Line 23).
  * In some scenarios each `Time Value` will correspond with the time at which the `Data Object` came into existence. However, this is certainly not the case for all scenarios. For example, each `Time Value` might be used to map the `Data Object` onto a future point in time.

### Notes on `Data Object`s

* `Data Object`s might depend on each other (for example, inter-frame coded video containing B/P frames; with AAC coded audio multiple `Data Object`s are needed in order to be able to decode the audio). Any such inter-dependencies are not modelled here.
* In practical media applications, `Data Object`s will typically contain data for a single media sample but could contain multiple media samples.
* Regardless of how each `Data Object` is constructed, multiple `Data Object`s might be packaged together in `Flow Representation`s. For example, a real system might choose to always transport `Data Object`s in packages of ten for practical reasons. This packaging must of course be completely reversible so that the original `Data Object`s and their `Time Value`s can be accessed.
* In practical media applications, a `Data Object` will typically be mono-essence, but it could be multi-essence. Essence data might exist in both mono-essence and multi-essence `Flow`s. Mapping between these `Flow`s might be necessary. For example, it might be useful to state that one multi-essence `Flow` (video + audio) contains all of the data required to (reversibly) create two mono-essence `Flow`s (one video and one audio).
* A `Data Object` can appear in a `Flow` more than once. `Data Object`s are not owned by a `Flow` and so a `Data Object` can be used by more than one `Flow`.
